## My process

- I got my project folder set up and the tailwind.config.js file up and running.
- I wrote the custom colors and fonts used by the challenge/design in the extend object of the tailwind config file.
- Since it was my very first time using tailwind, I slowly searched in the docs what I needed.
- After making the desktop layout (I know, I should be building mobile first) I wrote the Tailwind necessary to make it work with md and sm breakpoints.
- After a LOT of annoying problems when trying to host the website on Netlify (First time deploying a website with more than a single .css and .html file), I finally deployed it.

### Built with

- TailwindCSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was my first time using TailwindCSS and it has proven to be my favorite tool to style websites!
I also learned how to host more complex projects on Netlify, my hosting platform of choice.

### Continued development

I'll try to use TailwindCSS with JS Frameworks like React once I learn them since it's not fun having messy HTML files with super long classes (and because it would still be a better option)

### Useful resources

- [The TailwindCSS Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - You don't need Youtube tutorials about Tailwind, here is covered everything I learned and more (of course, it's the official docs)
